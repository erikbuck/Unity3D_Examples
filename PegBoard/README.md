This project implements a simple physics based "peg board" a.k.a. "Pachinko" game. The score is displayed using UI.Text. A simple C# script handles user input, calculates score when a ball falls off the bottom of the board, and resets the ball for the next turn.

- Press SPACE to launch the ball. 
- If you press SPACE multiple times before the ball leaves its launch channel, the ball launches faster.
