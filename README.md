# Examples provided in class

In most of the courses taught by Erik M. Buck, the focus is placed on concepts and terminology. The courses attempt to explain "what" technologies exist with examples and "why" Computer Scientists apply specific technological idioms. Answering "what" and "why" provides the core value of a college course. The Internet is full of answers to "how". Armed with the concepts, it is usually straightforward for students to use the terminology to find specific implementation details in preferred languages for chosen platforms. Without the concepts and terms, it is nearly impossible to find good answers.

The universe of game programming is so vast and diverse that it's impossible to anticipate every specific "how" question students may ask in class. Mr. Buck commonly produces small samples/examples during class as "live programming performance art" to illustrate "how" he would attempt to accomplish various tasks of interest to students. An ongoing part of the performance is a dialog about "why" Mr. Buck choses one approach over another with analysis of trade-offs.

This repository contains some of the in-class examples produced by Mr. Buck for CS-3900-B01 - "Game Programming" in Summer 2018 at Wright State University. Due to the limited time for programming demonstrations, the examples are typically small and tightly focussed on answering as specific question about "how" to accomplish something.
