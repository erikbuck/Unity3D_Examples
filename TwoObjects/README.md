This project uses physics and implements two "Gauge" objects. This is an example of creating 3D user interface elements and using the Unity editor to connect two or more objects together. Note how the Cannon.cs script and the PowerBar.cs script are used together.

- Up and down keys chnage the power of the cannon shot 
- "W" and "S" keys change the elevation of the cannon.
- "A" pauses the physics simulation, and "D" resumes it.
- Press SPACE to fire the cannon.
